# AppAdder
On Ubuntu, have you ever run a program or AppImage and the app not had an icon?
This is a personal pet peeve. I've used [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher)
to install AppImage files, but sometimes the programs don't have icons.

If this is something you run into, maybe you can relate to the annoyance of not
having an icon to go with an app you use all the time. AppAdder lets you install
any kind of app to the dash menu and set a custom icon and name for the file.

## Installation
Currently, an AppAdder release has not been made official yet, but stay tuned! We expect
to have the first useable program available by May 18th, 2021!
